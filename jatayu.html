    This rock-theme nature park was the first Public–private partnership tourism initiative
    in the state of Kerala under the BOT model. The park is about 38 km (24 mi) away from
    the city of Kollam and 46 km (29 mi) away from the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram.
    
    After completion, it opened to visitors on 17 August 2018.

    <h2>Origins</h2>
    The park located near the town of Chadayamangalam (Jatayumangalam), which was named for Jatayu.
    Jatayu was a demi-god in Ramayana (a Hindu epic) who had the form of a vulture.

    According to the epic, Ravana was attempting to abduct Sita to Lanka when Jatayu tried to rescue
    her. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old Ravana soon defeated him,
    clipping his wings, and Jatayu fell onto the rocks in Chadayamangalam. Rama and Lakshmana while
    on the search for Sita, chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu, who informed them of the
    battle with Ravana and told them that Ravana had headed South.

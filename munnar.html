    <h2>Nickname: The Kashmir of South India</h2>
    Munnar is a town and hill station in the Idukki district of
    the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres
    (5,200 ft) above mean sea level,[3] in the Western Ghats mountain range. Munnar
    is also called the "Kashmir of South India" and is a popular honeymoon destination.
    The name Munnar is believed to mean "three rivers",[4] referring to its location
    at the confluence of the Mudhirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundali rivers.[5]

    The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan
    for thousands of years.[6] Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of
    Wellington, was the first British person to pass through Munnar during Tippu Sultan's
    campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey of the terrain
    was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816â€“1817, who followed the Periyar into
    the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from
    which the name of Munnar is derived.[7]

    It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras,
    instructed Col. Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the
    Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing sanatoria
    for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering
    the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest
    but also paddy cultivation in the north-central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton
    climbed throughout the Ghats in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted
    that much of Munnar's land was suitable for coffee plantations. Munro, Henry Turn and
    his half-brother AW Turner obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the Raja of
    Travancore and began clearing forest around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other
    Europeans began establishing tea plantations in the area throughout the 1880s.
    Early plantations had few facilities and were mainly huts of straw. Most labourers
    on the tea estates were Dalits from present-day Tamil Nadu.

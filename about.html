    <h3>Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India,
      is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of
      the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous
      especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its unique
      culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one
      of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%,
      the tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy.

    Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination,
    with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country.
    Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development
    Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the
    state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the
    decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into one of
    the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala God's Own Country
    was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is
    regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall.[4] In 2010
    Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.[5]

    Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists.
    Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain
    ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include
    the beaches at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad; backwater tourism and
    lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar,
    Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife
    sanctuaries at Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam, Silent Valley National Park
    and Eravikulam National Park. The "backwaters" region—an extensive network
    of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Vembanad Lake, also
    see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace,
    Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. To further promote
    tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the
    Government of Kerala in 2007.[6] Since then it has been held every year
    during the DecemberJanuary period.

    The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism,
    which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering
    and personal growth of the local population. Efforts are taken to
    minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural
    environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people.The state has also made
    deep inroads into MICE Tourism mainly centered at Kochi.

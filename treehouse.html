    A tree house, tree fort or treeshed is a platform or building constructed around,
    next to or among the trunk or branches of one or more mature trees while above
    ground level. Tree houses can be used for recreation, work space, habitation,
    a hangout space and observation.

    Historically trees have been used as part of creating a building.
    For example the walls of a chapel, to hold platforms or houses built
    onto them or around them. ChÃªne chapelle is a striking example of a
    \tree as part of the building.[4] Modern tree houses are usually built
    as play areas for children or for leisure purposes. Modern tree houses
    may also be integrated into existing hotel facilities. Some tree houses
    are built for living space. The main part of the structure is built with
    industrial materials. This is movement towards "living architecture".

    Along with subterranean and ground level houses, tree houses are an option for
    building eco-friendly houses in remote forest areas, because they do not require a
    clearing of a certain area of forest. However, the wildlife, climate and illumination
    on ground level in areas of dense close-canopy forest is not desirable to some people.
